# Two virtual networks

## Overview

This document expects you to have set up OpenVNet according to the
[installation guide](../installation), created the simple
[single network](single-network) and set up
[its DHCP server](single-network-dhcp). We will be continuing from
there so complete those guides first.

In this guide we will set up a second virtual network and move `inst2`
to it. We'll also set up a new DHCP server for that network. That will
give us the following topology.

## Setup

The first two steps are similar to what we have done before. Create a
new network and setup its simulated DHCP service.


### Create the new network

```bash
vnctl networks add \
  --uuid nw-test2 \
  --display-name testnet2 \
  --ipv4-network 192.168.50.0 \
  --ipv4-prefix 24 \
  --network-mode virtual
```


### Set up its DHCP server

```bash
vnctl interfaces add \
  --uuid if-dhcp2 \
  --mode simulated \
  --owner-datapath-uuid dp-test1 \
  --mac-address 02:00:00:00:01:12 \
  --network-uuid nw-test2 \
  --ipv4-address 192.168.50.100


vnctl network-services add \
  --uuid ns-dhcp2 \
  --interface-uuid if-dhcp2 \
  --type dhcp
```


### Move inst2 to the new network

There are two ways to do this.

* The quick and dirty way. Remove the interface and re-create it.

* The clean but slightly harder way. Dig a little deeper into
  OpenVNet's inner workings make only the required changes.

Choose one of the two two ways below.


#### The quick and dirty way.

To keep things simple, we will just remove `inst2` from OpenVNet's
database and re-create it.

A side effect of this method is that we will not be able to use the
same UUID. That's because OpenVNet's database uses logical
delete. Deleted records aren't actually removed but only marked as
deleted. Their unique fields cannot be reused.

```bash
vnctl interfaces del if-inst2
```

Now re-create it. Since we can't reuse the UUID `if-inst2`, we'll use
`if-newinst2`.

```bash
vnctl interfaces add \
  --uuid if-newinst2 \
  --mode vif \
  --owner-datapath-uuid dp-test1 \
  --mac-address 10:54:ff:00:00:02 \
  --network-uuid nw-test2 \
  --ipv4-address 192.168.50.10 \
  --port-name inst2
```

You're done. Move on to the [test section](#test).


#### The clean but slightly harder way

We've now created several network interfaces in OpenVNet using the
[vnctl interfaces add](../vnctl/interfaces) command. Actually every
time we call that command, OpenVNet creates several fields in the
database  to keep track of MAC address, IP address, network assignment
etc. The field we need to change here is `ip lease`.

First have a look at `inst2`'s interface.

```bash
vnctl interfaces show if-inst2
```

As you can see, there's quite a bit of information to be had here. The
part we're interested in is `ip lease` and more specifically, the `ip
lease UUID`. Look for it in the output.

```bash
---
:id: 2
:uuid: if-inst2
:mode: vif
...
:mac_leases:
- :id: 2
  :uuid: ml-sa4dusgn
  :interface_id: 2
  ...
  :ip_leases:
  - &1
    :id: 2
    :uuid: il-36cl1ou4 # <== This is what we're looking for.
    :interface_id: 2
    ...
```

In this example it's `il-36cl1ou4` but it will be something else on
your environment. These UUIDs are randomly generated by OpenVNet when
a new resource is created.

Now run the following two commands, deleting the old ip lease and
creating a new one on the new network. Replace `il-36cl1ou4` with the
correct ip lease UUID for your environment.

```bash
./bin/vnctl ip-leases del il-36cl1ou4
./bin/vnctl ip-leases add --interface-uuid if-inst2 --network-uuid nw-test2 --ipv4-address 192.168.50.10
```

That's it. The `inst2` interface has now moved to the new network we created.


## Test

Log into `inst2` and have it perform a new DHCP request.

```bash
lxc-console -n inst2
service network restart
```

If everything went well, `inst2` should now have received IP address
`192.168.50.10`. Now try pinging `inst1`.

```bash
ping 10.100.0.10
```

If you did things right, ping should have now told you that `inst1`'s
network is unreachable. That's exactly right. Our LXC guests are now
in two different networks and have no route to each other.


## What's next?

Now that we have two different networks, let's try
[using a simulated router](two-networks-router) to connect them
together.
