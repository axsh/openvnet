    # Currently only supports a single network or segment for each
    # interface and it is not safe to have more than one dp_nw/seg for
    # an interface.
    #
    # For now the dp_nw/seg will only work if it already exists when
    # the datapath is initialized, and has an ip_lease_id of nil.
    #
    # The dp_nw/seg idea seem not to be viable due to there only being
    # possible to have one dp+nw combination.
    #
    # Thus we should use the vna.conf file for tests until we add
    # interface_networks where an interface can be added to a network
    # without an ip_lease.
