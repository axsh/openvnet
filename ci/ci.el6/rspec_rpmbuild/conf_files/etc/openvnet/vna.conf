#
#       id : The ID of the OpenVNet's process. It should be unique among the entire world of the OpenVNet.
#
# protocol : This parameter can be used to specify the 0MQ address. Default value is 'tcp'.
#
#     host : Private IP address that can be used to specify the 0MQ address. 
#
#   public : Public/Global IP address that is linked to the private IP address specified by the 'host' parameter.
#            A 0MQ socket will be created with the public/global IP address if this paramter is specified.
#            Otherwise 'host' parameter will be used to create a 0MQ socket.
#
#     port : Listen port of the process.
#

#
# switch : The switch for VNA to connect when using the ovs-ofctl or ovs-vsctl commands.
#          If not provided VNA will use the Datapath ID in the database to looks for an instance of OVS
#          running on the same host as VNA.
#
#          The value of `switch` will be fed directly to the ovs-ofctl command and thus supports any format
#          that ovs-ofctl can take.
#
#          ssl:ip[:port]
#          tcp:ip[:port]
#          unix:file
#          bridge
#          [type@]dp
#
#          Example: 'tcp:192.168.3.101:6653'
#          Example: 'ssl:172.16.15.100:6653'
#          Example: 'br1'
#
#          Check the ovs-ofctl man page for more details.

#
# ovsdb : This option can be used to make VNA connect to a remote OVSDB running on another host. If OVSDB is
#         running locally which is the most common case, this option can be omitted.
#
#         The value of `ovsdb` will be fed directly to the ovs-vsctl command's --db= parameter. Therefore it
#         supports any format `ovs-vsctl --db=` supports
#
#         ssl:ip:port
#         tcp:ip:port
#         unix:file
#         pssl:port[:ip]
#            The  --private-key, --certificate, and
#            --ca-cert options are mandatory when this form is used.
#         ptcp:port[:ip]
