#    Given a directory containing a file named 'nic.info', 
# generates a list of strings defining VBoxManage commands
# to setup a nic of the given type, attached to the given
# host adapter/bridge.
#
# nic.info is expected to be of the form:
# 
# ethN  nic_type  host_connection
# ethN  nic_type  host_connection
# ethN  nic_type  host_connection
#
# Here, nic_type is a type name recognized by virtualbox.
# This will typically be 'hostonly' or 'nat'. The
# host_connection gives the bridge on the host to
# which the nic should be connected.
# 
# !! Important !! 
#
# The order of the ethN devices is important! eth0 should
# always be given first -- it is device "nic1" as far
# as virtualbox is concerned. 
# 
#
# Usage: nic_info.sh dirname
#
# dirname gives the directory with the nic.info file.
