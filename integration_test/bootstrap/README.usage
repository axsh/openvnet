    Three principle scripts are used to build and setup the test environment:

  (1)  build_int_env.sh         - Builds the itest-edge, itest1, itest2, itest3 & router virtual machines

       USAGE:
         The script may be run in two modes:
  
             ./build_int_env.sh  6.5

             ./build_int_env.sh  6.5  -basebox ovf-file-with-path

          In the latter case, the user gives the name of the basebox to use for provisioning.


       Dependencies:
          - packer
          - VirtualBoxManage

  (2)  init_host_bridges.sh     - Sets up the host-only 'bridges' on the mac/host machine

       USAGE:  ./init_host_bridges.sh

            This generates the hostonly bridges on the host. The interfaces are named "vboxnet0", "vboxnet1", 
        "vboxnet2" & "vboxnet3" by VBoxManage.

  (3)   system_startup.sh       - Imports the vm's built in step (1) into VirtualBox and boots them up
         
       USAGE:  ./system_startup.sh

  (4)   branch_sync.sh          - Synchronize the source code of the current branch into the vm's running openvnet

       USAGE:  ./branch_sync.sh


  PROBLEMS:

      -  Not much cleanup!  I have kept output from these scripts (for example, packer template files)
         so that I can debug. 

      - The code needs a lot of refactoring...
